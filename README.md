# GIFExplorer

An educational tool for exploring different parts of a GIF file.

The project includes a custom-built GIF parser that is partially compatible with the GIF 89a specification. Although, the parser can't parse all features stated in the specs, it can detect unsupported features and skip them without throwing any errors.
